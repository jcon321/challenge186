[Easy] Bag Inventory:
Description:

So to help out all the trick or treaters we need to develop a tool to help inventory their candy haul for the night. You will be given a text file that contains a listing of every piece of candy in the bag. Your challenge is to develop a solution to inventory the candy and print out a summary of how much candy you got.

You must answer these basic questions

    How many pieces of candy did you get
    How much of each type
    What percentage of total candy does that type occupy

Input:

Use this gist listing as your text file to represent your bag of candy. Candy Bag Link
Output:

You must answer the basic questions. How you display it and present it we leave to the programmer to decide. Some suggestions could be a text output. Perhaps you do a histogram or pie chart. Maybe show a real time tally as you go through the bag counting the candy and display it as a gif for all to enjoy.
